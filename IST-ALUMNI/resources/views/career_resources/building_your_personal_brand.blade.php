                A personal brand can make you stand out in a crowded job market. Hereâ€™s how to build one:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Identify Your Strengths</strong>: Think about what makes you unique and the skills you bring to the table.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Consistent</strong>: Keep your message and tone consistent across your resume, LinkedIn, and other professional platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Create Content</strong>: Share insights or write articles related to your field to establish yourself as a knowledgeable professional.</li>
                <li><strong>Engage with Others</strong>: Comment on posts, join discussions, and support others in your network.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                Your personal brand is a reflection of who you are professionally, and it can help you attract the right career opportunities.
